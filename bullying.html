									<h2>1. Preamble</h2>

									<p>
									This document is the bullying and cyberbullying policy of Welkom High School, as approved by the school governing body. The policy has been drafted in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of South Africa, 1996; the South African Schools Act 84 of 1996 (‘SASA’); the National Education Policy Act 27 of 1996; applicable provincial legislation on school education; the Protection from Harassment Act 17 of 2011; the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989. 
									All learners have the right to attend a public school that is a safe and secure learning environment. It is the intent of Welkom High School to provide all learners with an equitable opportunity to learn. To that end, the school has a significant interest in providing a safe, orderly and respectful school environment, which is conducive to teaching and learning.  <br>
									Bullying is detrimental to the school environment and to learners’ learning, achievement and well-being. It interferes with the mission of the school to educate learners, and disrupts school operations. Bullying affects not only learners who are targets, but also those who participate in and witness such behaviour. It must be addressed to ensure learner safety and an inclusive learning environment.

									This policy must be read in conjunction with the school’s Code of Conduct for Learners, of which it forms an integral part.</p>
