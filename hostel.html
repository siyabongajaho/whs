									<h5>Hostel Rules</h5>
									<p>While many of the rules may, for the prospective learner, appear negative and restrictive, this is not the case. Rules are in place to promote co-operation, respect for fellow learners and staff, the smooth running of the hostel, a positive study atmosphere and happy and healthy relationships between staff, prefects and learners.</p>
 

<p>It is imperative for all Eddie East Hostel boarders to be fully acquainted with the rules of the hostel.</p>

<h5>Return Times</h5>

<p>1.1 Between 16:00 and 19:00 on the day before school starts at the beginning of each term. No learner will be allowed into the hostel after 19:00 without special arrangement with the Hostel Manager. These times also apply to weekends.</p>

<h5>General Rules</h5>

<p>2.1 Hostel learners are expected to maintain the buildings and the grounds of the hostel so that it is neat and tidy at all times. Damage to hostel properly is not tolerated. Any damage incurred due to negligence or violation of rules will be for the transgressor’s account.<br>

2.2 Respect for hostel property/the possessions of other hostel learners is crucial to the smooth running of the hostel. Learners who do not respect this basic value do not belong at the Welkom High School hostel.<br>

2.3 Respect for people renting rooms at the hostel is also important – noise levels should be kept at an acceptable level.<br>

2.4 Soccer/ball games are not allowed on the hostel lawns; the adjacent soccer field should be used.<br>

2.9 Smoking/taking drugs/consumption of alcohol will lead to immediate cancellation of town visit on Wednesdays as well as suspension for one week. Severe cases may lead to expulsion from the hostel.<br>

2.10 A learner found to have left the hostel/school grounds without permission will be viewed in a serious light. The hostel staff will not be held responsible for such learner/s, and parents will usually be asked to make alternative arrangements for such learners as soon as possible.<br>

3.3 Posters are not allowed on walls. Posters are permitted on cupboards but should only be attached with prestik. Sexually explicit or abusive posters are not permitted. Nothing may be written on the furniture or mirrors. Such action will lead to immediate punishment.<br>
